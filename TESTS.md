# Test plan

Back to [README](https://github.com/Carina-P/ms3-best-books/blob/master/README.md)

The bellow plan for testing was followed during development of the site:
The TDD, **TestDriven Development**, process is followed. Test cases is
developed/thought off, before code is implemented. The test process is
conducted in an iterativ manner and implementation cycles are short with
small code parts every time. 

Before new code is commited, testing of all code developed earlier are
tested again.

When all features are implemented and tested the following tests are 
performed:
- Go through the test cases for functional testing and testing of
responsiveness, as described below
- **HTML-code validated** by 
[W3S Markup validation service](https://validator.w3.org/)
- **CSS-cod validated** by 
[W3S CSS validation service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- **JavaScript-code validated** by [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)
- The site is tested on different browsers, as described below
- The deployed version is tested

<!-- Manual testing only or automated tests also? - description of each!! -->

## Test Cases/Scenarios
Functionality tests and tests of responsiveness is done by following test cases
below.
Test of responsiveness is mainly performed with help of Chrome Developers Tool. 
But the site is also tested with iPad mini and iPhone8.



## UX testing
UX testing is conducted by watching and interviewing users when they used
the page. Examples of issues/discussions:

## Code validation
## Different browsers

## Some of the bugs

## Remaining bugs
