# Test plan

Back to [README](https://github.com/Carina-P/ms3-best-books/blob/master/README.md)

The TDD, **TestDriven Development**, process was followed. Test cases have
been developed/thought off, before code was implemented. The test process have
been conducted in an iterativ manner and implementation cycles have been short with
small code parts every time. 

Before new code was commited, testing of all code developed earlier was
tested again.

When all features were implemented and tested the following tests were 
performed:
- Went througt the test cases, for functional testing and testing of
responsiveness, as described below
- **HTML-code validated** by 
[W3S Markup validation service](https://validator.w3.org/)
- **CSS-cod validated** by 
[W3S CSS validation service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- **JavaScript-code validated** by [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)
- The site was tested on **different browsers**, as described below
- The deployed version was tested
